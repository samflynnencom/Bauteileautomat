Bauteileautomat
===============

This project merges the three branches of the student project "Bauteileautomat", a component vending machine built by students of the university of applied sciences Karlsruhe.
We all know the problem of working on a specific project and suddenly you encounter a missing part. And often it is a pretty common part like a 47k resistor you forgot to restock. That's where our vending machine comes into play. the machine holds the most common components and offers them to the students on the cheap.
